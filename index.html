                <h4>May 2017 - Current</h4>
                <p>MiCasa is a property management company of short-term rentals whose business needs were simple: build a web app to showcase property listings, allow users to find contact and business information, launch the app in the cloud with a custom domain, and implement a simple backend solution that can grab listings from a database. This web app was developed using Angular 4 which connected to a Firebase backend for compute and database services. Other skills exercised included HTML5, CSS/SASS, and TypeScript.</p>

                    <h4>April 2017 - Current</h4>
                    <p>This application takes advantage of the realtime cloud database Firebase. It is built using Angular 2, CSS Flex, and Angular Material for styling guidelines. This application uses Firebase's authentication tools to connect every chat user to their Google account. My next design step is to fix the styling and implement profiles for each user.</p>

                    <h4>March 2017 - Current</h4>
                    <p>This application started off as a tutorial about getting started with Angular. However as the tutorial went on I became quite bored with the application that we were building. I have always wanted to build a sort of personal database where I could keep track of all the video games I have played. I proceeded to convert the entire project to my own application and redid all the styling. The project is building using Angular, Bootstrap and uses a local JSON document as the backend. My next addition will be connecting it to a cloud database.</p>
